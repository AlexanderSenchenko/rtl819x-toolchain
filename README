Linux SDK for ALFA AIP-W512
---------------------------

== Overview
This toolchain allows you to build custom firmware image for the ALFA Network AIP-W512 Wireless AP/router. 
The SoC of this board is RTL8196E, based on a Lexra core (modified MIPS).

Some applications have been added in the source tree:
* dropbear
* libpcap
* tcpdump
* ettercap

== Disclaimer

Flash at your own risk.

== Requirements

A linux host.
This toolchain has been tested on 32-bit Ubuntu 9.10, 13.10 and on 64-bit Debian Jessie.

== Configuration

To configure the toolchain for the AIP-W512 board, use this command in top directory:
> $ make menuconfig

	> Selected Target : rtl8196e
	> Selected Kernel : linux-2.6.30
	> Selected Busybox : busybox-1.13
	> Selected toolchain : rsdk-1.3.6-4181-EB-2.6.30-0.9.30
	> Selected board configuration : 96E+88E GW
	> Config users : yes

Then exit and save this new configuration.
The next configuration screen allows you to choose built-in applications.
(Only ettercap, dropbear and tcpdump have been tested at this time.)
Again, exit and save this new configuration.

** Known issue **
If you get the error "Error :  error opening terminal xterm", create this symbolic link:
> # ln -s /lib/terminfo/x/xterm /usr/share/terminfo/x/xterm

== Build

> $ make

Generated firmware image (rootfs+kernel)
$top/image/fw.bin

** Known issue **
If you get the error:
libtool eval: 1: libtool_args+=: not found
libtool eval: 1: compile_command+=: not found
...

you have to link /bin/sh file to /bin/bash :
> # unlink /bin/sh
> # ln -s /bin/bash /bin/sh
> $ export SHELL=/bin/bash

== Filesystem customization

To customize /etc/ directory, you can edit files in $top/target/etc.default/.

Otherwise, you can edit 'romfs' target in $top/target/Makefile to add files.
e.g. to add a root directory: $(ROMFSINST) root /root

You must rebuild to apply changes:

> $ make

== Flash

A successful build generates few images:
$top/image/linux.bin (kernel)
$top/image/root.bin (rootfs)
$top/image/webpages.bin (web pages)
$top/image/fw.bin (kernel+rootfs+web pages)

You have to flash fw.bin (never tried others) by following one of these methods:

 * TFTP (bootloader):
	- Connect LAN ethernet port of the device to your network
	- Find out serial port
		UART Pinout
		->1 VCC (with arrow on PCB)
		  2 TX
		  3 RX
		  4 GND
	- Connect UART port with settings: 38400 8N1
		> # screen /dev/ttyUSB0 38400 8N1
	- Press 'Esc' key at boot to interrupt
	- Here a shell. Enter '?' to get help message
	- Enter 'IPCONFIG' command to display device's IP address, and modify if needed
	- Upload image by TFTP
		> $ atftp -p -l $top/image/fw.bin 192.168.1.6

 * Web interface (tcp/80): In the menu >Management>Upgrade firmware

Network configuration won't be altered.
Default root password is 'root'.
